# ttbb-tth(bb) Classifier

ttbb-tth(bb) Classifier is used to differentiate the event information generated by the signal versus background within a particle collision.

The algorithm is assembled with three distinctive machine learning approaches:

> Neural Networks (DNN)

> Gradient Boosting

> Random Forest
